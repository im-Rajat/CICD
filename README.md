# CI/CD

- CI/CD, which stands for continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD)
- Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CI/CD) are software development practices that aim to improve the development and delivery process through automation, collaboration, and continuous feedback
  
## Continuous Integration (CI):

- **Definition:** CI is a development practice that involves automatically integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository multiple times a day.
- **Objective:** Detect and address integration issues early, ensuring that the codebase is always in a consistent and working state.

## Continuous Delivery (CD):

- **Definition**: CD is an extension of CI and involves automating the process of delivering software to production-like environments. It ensures that the code is always in a deployable state.
- **Objective:** Reduce manual intervention in the software delivery process, making it faster, more reliable, and repeatable.

## Continuous Deployment (CD):

- **Definition:** CD takes the automation a step further by automatically deploying code changes to production after passing the necessary tests.
- **Objective:** Deliver new features, enhancements, or bug fixes to end-users rapidly and reliably.

# Jenkins:

- **Definition:** Jenkins is an open-source automation server that provides hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying, and automating any project.
- **Objective:** Jenkins is used for implementing CI/CD pipelines. It helps automate various stages of the software development lifecycle, from building and testing to deployment.
